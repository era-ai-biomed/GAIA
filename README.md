# GAIA Workshop @ ICCV 2025

This repository contains the website for the First Workshop on Generative AI for Biomedical Image Analysis (GAIA) at ICCV 2025.

## About

The GAIA Workshop explores how generative AI is reshaping biomedical image analysis, creating new possibilities and solutions for healthcare. This workshop focuses on three critical areas:

### 1. Data Synthesis and Clinical Modeling
- Generating anatomically accurate medical images
- Addressing class imbalances in medical datasets
- Cross-modal image synthesis (e.g., MRI to CT)
- Disease progression modeling and simulation
- Synthetic lesion generation for training enhancement

### 2. Multimodal Learning
- Integration of generative AI with large language models (LLMs)
- Combining visual data with medical reports and EHRs
- Enhanced clinical communication and decision-making
- Addressing interpretability and AI-generated inaccuracies

### 3. Workflow Automation
- Intelligent AI agents for medical imaging workflows
- Automated routine medical inspections and analysis
- Automated delineation of radiotherapy target areas
- Improving efficiency and consistency in clinical practices
